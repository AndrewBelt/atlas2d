# Atlas 2D Client-Server API



## Definitions
These are structures that are referred to by name in this document.

### component
A component can be any JSON value you like: an object, array, or scalar.
For some commands, you can send partial "diffs" of components,
and the client will merge the new values with the old ones.

### entity
An entity is only made up of named components.
Every entity has a unique ID (a Number or String), but it is not sent
in the entity object itself.

{
  <component-name>: <component>,
  ...
}



## Commands (server --> client)
Commands are sent from the server to the client as JSON objects.
Each command is a JSON object, with the 'cmd' key as the name of the
command and the arguments specified with their keys.
