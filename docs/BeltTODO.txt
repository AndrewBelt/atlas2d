## Server problems

Do we even need a database?
- As with Atlas1D, we could load all entities from a marshalled file,
  and save when we are finished, so all of the entities stay in memory.

Should any information in an entity be private to the client?
- I want to say no, since entities should contain as little data as possible.

How should the "identity" of graphics be held?
- I think tiles and items should use the same key for its icon.


## Client problems

Use 16x16 chunks instead of individual tiles?

Send a player movement command only when the player moves from one tile
to the next?
- Sending only integer coordinates, and less often would reduce bandwidth.
- Mobs must have extrapolated movement on the client.
